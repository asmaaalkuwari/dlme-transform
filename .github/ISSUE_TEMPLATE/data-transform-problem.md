## What Has Changed?

examples:
- there is new data from XXX
- we need to add a new field to all the collections
- someone noticed all the values for Y in the Z collection are wrong



## What Are You Trying To Do?

This is in a broader sense than "getting this macro to work":

examples:
- get the new data from XXX to load cleanly
- populate field X for the Y collection
- add language tags to the X field for X,Y,Z collections
- fix the values in field X for the Y collection
- load the XXX collection into stage|prod|dev



## What Approaches, If Any, Have You Tried?

examples:
- I am waiting for developer help before I do anything
- I wrote the macro xxx in this git branch, and ...
- I tried to break up a giant dataset into pieces (to find records with bad data) with this approach
